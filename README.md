## Exercise 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Exercise 2 - Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
                
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
                
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
